      <p>
        Spreadsheets and desktop software got a lot of businesses a long way. But as a practice
        grows, manual files and version-control headaches quietly become a tax on everyone&apos;s
        time. Cloud accounting removes most of that friction — and it changes what you can offer
        clients.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-time instead of rear-view</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest shift is timing. With spreadsheets you&apos;re always looking backwards: the
        numbers are only as current as the last manual update. Cloud platforms pull transactions
        through automatically, so the picture is live. That makes cash-flow conversations, forecasts
        and advisory work far more useful because they&apos;re based on what&apos;s happening now.
      </p>

      <h2>Fewer errors, less manual work</h2>
      <p>
        Manual re-keying is where mistakes creep in. Cloud tools reduce that dramatically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bank feeds import transactions instead of someone typing them in.</li>
        <li>Rules and automation handle repetitive coding.</li>
        <li>Reconciliations flag mismatches early, before they reach year-end.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result is cleaner data and a much smoother close — both monthly and at year-end.
      </p>

      <h2>Access, security and collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        Because the data lives in one place, your team and the client can work from the same source
        of truth at the same time — no emailing files back and forth. Reputable platforms also back
        data up and encrypt it, which is usually safer than a spreadsheet sitting on a single laptop.
      </p>

      <h2>Making the switch without the disruption</h2>
      <p>
        The hesitation is almost always about migration: nobody wants to lose history or break
        reporting mid-year. That&apos;s exactly the part worth getting expert help with. A staged,
        reconciled migration moves the data across intact and sets the system up around how you
        actually work.
