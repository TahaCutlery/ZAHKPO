            <h2>Information we collect</h2>
            <p>
              We collect information you give us directly — such as your name, company, email and
              phone number when you contact us or request a service — along with technical data like
              usage information and cookies gathered automatically when you visit this website.
            </p>

            <h2>How we use your information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide and manage the services you request;</li>
              <li>Respond to enquiries and provide customer support;</li>
              <li>Improve our website and detect or fix technical issues;</li>
              <li>Send relevant updates where you have asked to hear from us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Legal basis for processing</h2>
            <p>
              We process personal data on one or more of the following bases: your consent; the
              performance of a contract; compliance with a legal obligation; and our legitimate
              business interests, where these are not overridden by your rights.
            </p>

            <h2>Sharing your information</h2>
            <p>
              We do not sell your personal data. We may share it with trusted service providers who
              help us operate, in connection with a business transfer, or where we are required to do
              so by law.
            </p>

            <h2>Data security</h2>
            <p>
              We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your personal information,
              including strict confidentiality agreements, password-protected systems, controlled
              access to client data and secure, cloud-based file sharing with regular backups. No
              method of transmission over the internet is completely secure, but we work hard to
              protect your data and follow GDPR-aligned practices throughout.
            </p>

            <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
            <p>
              Subject to applicable law, you may request to access, correct, erase, restrict, object
              to, or port your personal data. We aim to respond to valid requests within one month.
            </p>

            <h2>Data retention</h2>
            <p>
              We keep personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes it was
              collected for, including to satisfy legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
            </p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              We use cookies to support core functionality, analytics, preferences and, where
              relevant, advertising. You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page,
              so please review it periodically.
            </p>

            <h2>Governing law</h2>
            <p>This policy is governed by the laws of England and Wales.</p>
